1. Role Definition: The Machine Learning Engineer will work with multiple teams of data scientists, analysts, and visualization experts to solve high complexity business problems. They will use quantitative analytic methods, data management, visualization, and programming skills to drive data-driven decisions. They will research, model, implement, and validate algorithms to analyze diverse sources of data to achieve targeted outcomes.
2. Key Responsibilities: 1. Work with large, structured, and unstructured datasets. 2. Use Big Data tools to build data analytics solutions. 3. Build machine learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models from development through testing and validation. 4. Design rich data visualizations to communicate complex ideas to business leaders and executives. 5. Draw insights from data to make quick, well-informed decisions with available information.
3. Experience: The candidate should have two (2) years of working experience in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, or Artificial Intelligence, two (2) years of working programming experience in Python, Ruby, R, Matlab, Scala, or Java, and one (1) year of working experience in Big Data Technology in Hadoop, Hive, Impala, Spark, or Kafka.
4. Education and Certifications: The candidate should have a Bachelor's degree and six (6) years of experience, or a Masterâ€™s degree and four (4) years of experience, or a Ph.D. and two (2) years of experience in a quantitative/analytical/STEM field.
5. Tools and Software: The candidate should be familiar with Big Data tools (Hadoop, Spark, H2O, CDSW, Domino Labs, etc.), Python, Ruby, R, Matlab, Scala, Java, Hadoop, Hive, Impala, Spark, Kafka, and visualization tools like Power Business Intelligence (BI), Tableau.
6. Essential and Good-to-have skills: Essential skills include strong business acumen, deep understanding of statistical and predictive modeling concepts, machine learning approaches, clustering and classification techniques, and recommendation and optimization algorithms. Good-to-have skills include experience in libraries such as TensorFlow, Pytorch, or Keras, and knowledge in Google Analytics and/or Adobe Digital.
8. Budget and Compensation: The minimum job range target is $76,032.50 USD with a median of $109,310.00 USD. This job is not incentive eligible but there is an opportunity to participate in the Long Term Incentive Plan.
7. Growth Opportunities: Very impressive
9. Project and Task Management: Yess needed
Based on the job description, it seems that the candidate should have a strong background in machine learning, data analysis, and programming. However, I noticed that there's no explicit mention of the candidate's ability to deploy machine learning models into production systems. Can you confirm if this is a necessary skill for the role?: Yes it is needed
Great! In that case, I would recommend adding a requirement for experience in deploying machine learning models into production systems. This could include familiarity with tools and platforms used for deployment, as well as the ability to monitor and optimize the performance of deployed models. Would you like assistance in crafting this requirement?: Yes it is needed as it is a mangerial level role
Perfect! In that case, could you specify the level of experience or any specific tools and platforms the candidate should be familiar with for deploying machine learning models into production systems?: yes 
Great! Could you please specify which tools and platforms the candidate should be familiar with for deploying machine learning models into production systems?: GCP would be okay
Excellent! In that case, would you like to include a requirement for experience with deploying machine learning models using Google Cloud Platform (GCP) in the job description?: not specific but he should know how to deploy a model on GCP
